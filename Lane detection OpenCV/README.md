# Lane Detection
## Lane detection scripts by using OpenCV
Here are two differnt approach for lane detection using OpenCV.    
* The first with name `lane.py` is simple lane detection algorithm which uses Hough lines to frame received after preprocessing it by using Canny. This script get fixed ROI.  
* The second script named `advanced_lane.py`
